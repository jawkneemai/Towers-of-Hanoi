# Towers-of-Hanoi
This program simulates the solution Towers of Hanoi puzzle, supporting 3 rods and from 2-10 disks. It uses recursion to solve and the Stanford graphics library to display.

The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle that involves a certain number of rods (say 3) and disks (say 5). The disks all start on one rod and are stacked by size, with the largest on the bottom. The puzzle is to move all five disks to another rod in a manner that preserves the size order, by using the third rod as a helper. The breaks down each move into a recursive action.
